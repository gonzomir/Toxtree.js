jToxKit demo
==========

A single HTML page demonstrations of using jToxKit components to 

####Display chemical structures and properties with jToxDataset
[index.html](http://ideaconsult.github.io/Toxtree.js)

####Perform chemical search (exact, similarity, substructure) with jToxQuery and display results with jToxDataset
[ui-query.html](http://ideaconsult.github.io/Toxtree.js/ui-query.html)


The demo pages use remote [AMBIT](http://ambit.sf.net) servers at www.ideaconsult.net

Copy the page and customize to access the proper server.  You may choose to install your own [AMBIT](http://ambit.sf.net) server and populate with your own chemical datasets.
