TODO:
- Docs: change these: addSelection in README to really point to jToxKit.ui - ignoreOriginal, selection, details
- jToxComposition - start using showBanner!

IDEAS?
- (global) extractFeature(dataset, featureId) - return an array of values of that feature for each entry in the dataset. (Can be used for diagram)
- make toxtree part of jToxKit (jToxCompound - stationary version, i.e. - browsing compound through fixed blocks, iterating over them)

Assessment:
- Ability to re-use the built tab/features structures? Additional setting?
-
