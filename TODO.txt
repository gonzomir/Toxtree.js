TODO:
- When adding new endpoint value - form a JSON, similar to study.
- Collect matrix changes and send them at once.

- History of searches in jToxSearch component (along with type of search and additional parameters)

- make proper deleting process
- improve data recording process

DOCS:
- new handling mechanism with 'handler' property in each kit
- onRow universal handler
- jToxComoluns column ordering via 'order' field in feature definition
- jToxSearch slideInput property
- jToxCompound fixedWidth
- jToxKit.ui renderMulti
- 


FUTURE / IDEAS
- deferred re-query (postpone)
- Reduce network calls in ToxTree on run-all - postpone the call until the last model has ran.
- 

Assessment:
- Ability to re-use the built tab/features structures? Additional setting?
