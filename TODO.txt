TODO:
+ Reason / remark for bundle compounds.
+ Related substance query should be different.
+ Related to chosen substance in bundle (filterbybundle).
+ Remove related substances from endpoint (-1), the link should be standalone.
+ Provide bundle_uri on endpoint query.
+ Type & source should be removed from value popup, guidance: to take it from creator, shortened, if needed.
+ Not refreshing the assessment details on endpoint selection change - use flagging.
- When adding new endpoint value - form a JSON, similar to study.
- Collect matrix changes and send them at once.
- Delete popup - a confirmation and explanation.
+ New bundle procedure and inaprorpately initilized tabs

- Make size of fixed table configurable
- universal multi-column redenring


- History of searches in jToxSearch component (along with type of search and additional parameters)

- make proper deleting process
- improve data recording process

DOCS:
- new handling mechanism with 'handler' property in each kit
- onRow universal handler
- jToxComoluns column ordering via 'order' field in feature definition
- jToxSearch slideInput property


FUTURE / IDEAS
- deferred re-query (postpone)
- Reduce network calls in ToxTree on run-all - postpone the call until the last model has ran.
- 

Assessment:
- Ability to re-use the built tab/features structures? Additional setting?
