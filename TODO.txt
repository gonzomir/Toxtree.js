TODO:

- use ui-widget and ui-widget-header for foldable stuff
- add populateData(root, template, data) tool in ccLib

- hiding search pane
- foldable table view of the same information - at the bottom.
- old-style UI
- sizing of feature table - so that diagram is at the bottom

- jToxModel.getModel(algorithmUri, callback) routine (including polling task).
- glue jToxCompound with jToxSearch, jToxQuery,
- make onDetailedAlgo call the model creation / query...
- Result column for jToxModel to show prediction results

- make some docs - jToxCompound additions, tableLanguage, etc. updateCounter
- Make all kits react adequately on failure on network / calls
- deferred re-query (postpone)

IDEAS?
- (global) extractFeature(dataset, featureId) - return an array of values of that feature for each entry in the dataset. (Can be used for diagram)
- make toxtree part of jToxKit (jToxCompound - stationary version, i.e. - browsing compound through fixed blocks, iterating over them)

Assessment:
- Ability to re-use the built tab/features structures? Additional setting?
-
