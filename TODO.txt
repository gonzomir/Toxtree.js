- ccLib: fixes on flexSize function
- ToxTree: fix onresize reaction.

- ToxTree: checkboxes in the table

- Make all kits react adequately on failure on network / calls
- deferred re-query (postpone)

IDEAS?
- move classification related objects, CSS, and functions (like formatClassification) to jToxKit

Assessment:
- Ability to re-use the built tab/features structures? Additional setting?
