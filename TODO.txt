TODO:
- History of searches in jToxSearch component (along with type of search and additional parameters)
- make proper deleting process
- improve data recording process


FUTURE / IDEAS
- deferred re-query (postpone)
- Reduce network calls in ToxTree on run-all - postpone the call until the last model has ran.

Assessment:
- Ability to re-use the built tab/features structures? Additional setting?
