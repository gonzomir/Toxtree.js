TODO:

- jToxCompound - make feature list table as a separate routine
- jToxCompound - UI-less version - just for information retrieval
- 
- ToxTree ui page using existing stuff.
- Make all kits react adequately on failure on network / calls
- deferred re-query (postpone)

IDEAS?
- (global) extractFeature(dataset, featureId) - return an array of values of that feature for each entry in the dataset. (Can be used for diagram)
- make toxtree part of jToxKit (jToxCompound - stationary version, i.e. - browsing compound through fixed blocks, iterating over them)

Assessment:
- Ability to re-use the built tab/features structures? Additional setting?
-
