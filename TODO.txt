TODO:
- Customizable sDom on the jToxDataset.
- Sub-components in jToxQuery - subtrcture, sub, similarity, ketcher.
- How to build jToxQuery structure - put a <div> for each (sub)component, marked with proper tag. Each of the subcomponents adequately finds and uses the jToxQuery general component;
- 


IDEAS?
- (global) extractFeature(dataset, featureId) - return an array of values of that feature for each entry in the dataset. (Can be used for diagram)
- make toxtree part of jToxKit

Assessment:
- Ability to re-use the built tab/features structures? Additional setting?
-
