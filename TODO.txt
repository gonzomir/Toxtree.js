TODO:
- jToxKit - some universal way to add icons/components to Id tag.
- jToxKit - generalize onReady to whole events mechanism.
- ccLib - modify fireCallback() so it can work with array of handlers...
- jToxSubstance - a separate kit
- jToxComposition

IDEAS?
- (global) extractFeature(dataset, featureId) - return an array of values of that feature for each entry in the dataset. (Can be used for diagram)
- make toxtree part of jToxKit (jToxCompound - stationary version, i.e. - browsing compound through fixed blocks, iterating over them)

Assessment:
- Ability to re-use the built tab/features structures? Additional setting?
-
