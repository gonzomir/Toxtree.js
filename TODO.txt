For Nina:
- bundle status and dates during creation.
- Can you update just part of the bundle attributes?
- When adding a compound you should be able to specify either "source" or "target" - this is missing right now.
- What's the difference between POST and PUT there?
- 415: Media not supported on POST /compound
- How to determine whether a compound is already in the set? what happens if adding the same more than once?
- Doesn't seem to delete anything
- 

TODO:

- History of searches in jToxSearch component (along with type of search and additional parameters)

- make proper deleting process
- improve data recording process

- make it possible to add more than one edit-box line
- ?? make endpoint name and study type show directly into the matrix table

DOCS:
- new handling mechanism with 'handler' property in each kit
- onRow universal handler
- jToxComoluns column ordering via 'order' field in feature definition
- jToxSearch slideInput property


FUTURE / IDEAS
- deferred re-query (postpone)
- Reduce network calls in ToxTree on run-all - postopone the call until the last model has ran.
- 

Assessment:
- Ability to re-use the built tab/features structures? Additional setting?
