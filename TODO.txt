TODO:
- Introduce "data-widget" - similar to "data-kit".
- Make jToxSearch widget - for invoking queries for structure search - radio-button driven, similarity, ketcher drawing, etc.
- Add jT.widget(el) routine and save the initialized widget into data('jtWidget') entry.
- Make jToxQuery widget - for integratin _different_ types of search. Enumerate "data-query-id" entries, .widget() method, etc.
- Settings for jToxQuery should include handlers for given queryIds.
- Integrate jToxDataset, jToxSearch, wrapped with jToxQuery with exemplary menu


- Sub-components in jToxQuery - subtrcture, sub, similarity, ketcher.
- How to build jToxQuery structure - put a <div> for each (sub)component, marked with proper tag. Each of the subcomponents adequately finds and uses the jToxQuery general component;
- 


IDEAS?
- (global) extractFeature(dataset, featureId) - return an array of values of that feature for each entry in the dataset. (Can be used for diagram)
- make toxtree part of jToxKit

Assessment:
- Ability to re-use the built tab/features structures? Additional setting?
-
