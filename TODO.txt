TODO:

- checkboxes in the table

- make some docs - jToxCompound additions, tableLanguage, etc. updateCounter, noInterface and many others, extractFeatures, etc. queryUri...
- Make all kits react adequately on failure on network / calls
- deferred re-query (postpone)

IDEAS?

Assessment:
- Ability to re-use the built tab/features structures? Additional setting?
-
