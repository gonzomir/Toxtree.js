TODO:

- result presentation - integrate it in showPrediction
- checkboxes in the table

- make some docs - jToxCompound additions, tableLanguage, etc. updateCounter, noInterface and many others, extractFeatures, etc. queryUri...
- Make all kits react adequately on failure on network / calls
- deferred re-query (postpone)

IDEAS?
- (global) extractFeature(dataset, featureId) - return an array of values of that feature for each entry in the dataset. (Can be used for diagram)
- make toxtree part of jToxKit (jToxCompound - stationary version, i.e. - browsing compound through fixed blocks, iterating over them)

Assessment:
- Ability to re-use the built tab/features structures? Additional setting?
-
