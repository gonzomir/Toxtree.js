TODO:
- jToxCompound - make custom details, so that jToxSubstance can be incorporated.
- jToxKit - some universal way to add icons/components to Id tag.
- jToxSubstance - a separate kit
- jToxComposition

IDEAS?
- (global) extractFeature(dataset, featureId) - return an array of values of that feature for each entry in the dataset. (Can be used for diagram)
- make toxtree part of jToxKit

Assessment:
- Ability to re-use the built tab/features structures? Additional setting?
-
