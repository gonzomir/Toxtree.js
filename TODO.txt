TODO:
- docs: describe the new configuration option (citing a global variable)
- docs: jToxModel & jToxDataset

IDEAS?
- (global) extractFeature(dataset, featureId) - return an array of values of that feature for each entry in the dataset. (Can be used for diagram)
- make toxtree part of jToxKit

Assessment:
- Ability to re-use the built tab/features structures? Additional setting?
-
