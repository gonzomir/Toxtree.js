TODO:
- merge query settings, if jtox-widget is present in the jtox-toolkit definition.
- parse query parameters into internal structures / inputs in jToxSearch
- make sDom customizable;
- rename jToxDataset to jToxCompound
- make jToxModel for model listing (in tables);
- make jToxSource for data source listing (datasets) - in table;


IDEAS?
- (global) extractFeature(dataset, featureId) - return an array of values of that feature for each entry in the dataset. (Can be used for diagram)
- make toxtree part of jToxKit

Assessment:
- Ability to re-use the built tab/features structures? Additional setting?
-
